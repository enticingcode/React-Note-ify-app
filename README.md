<!-- **Here is a list of all the tasks you should complete:**

- Open a new directory on your computer with the name: Dbest-Note-App
- Pull your React-Note-App code from Github to this new directory
- Add React-Router to the project
- Add a Home Page (Route should Be / )
- Add a Contact Page (Route should Be /contact )
    - The Form doesn’t need to send the data anywhere right now
- Add a Notes Page (Route should be /notes)
- Make sure that each note has a different slug (Route should be /note/{note-title})
- Make sure that each note in the Sidebar has a:
    - Note title
    - Creation Date
    - Description
    
    **Tip:** Use the H1 as the note title and the first line as a short description
    
- Add Ellipsis at the end of the description if it's too long (description shouldn't exceed 50 chars)
- Add functionality to the Arrow button in the Sidebar -
    - When the Sidebar is open:
        - Close the sidebar when the button is clicked and rotate the button.
    - When the Sidebar is closed:
        - Open the sidebar when the button is clicked and rotate the button.
    - Optional - Add nice animation
    
    **Tip:** You can use CSS checkbox for this or the useState Hook + Template Literals in the CSS and toggle an animation based on the state
    
- Add Validation to the Contact Form Using Regex (You can read about what is regex [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/regular-expressions-clearly-explained-with-examples-822d76b037b4#:~:text=Regular%20expression%20is%20not%20a,space%20characters%20to%20special%20characters.))
    
    **Notice -** It's Ok to use Stackoverflow for the regex. The goal is that you will learn to use regex, but you don’t need to create the regex logic from scratch,
    
    - Name must contain only letters
    - Email should be a valid email
    - All fields cannot be empty (don’t use regex for this one)
- Show the proper Error when there is an invalid input in the contact form
- Push your code to a New Github Repo Named “Dbest-Note-App”
- Submit the GitHub link in the Google Form at the top of this page -->
